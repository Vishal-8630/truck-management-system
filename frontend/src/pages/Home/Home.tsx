            detail: `Outsourcing of logistics function is a business dynamics of growing importance all over the world. A growing awareness that competitive advantage comes from the delivery process as much as from the product has been instrumental in upgrading logistics from its traditional backroom function to a strategic boardroom function. In order to handle its logistics activities effectively and efficiently, a company may consider the following options it can provide the function in-house by making the service, or it can own logistics subsidiaries through setting up or buying a logistics firm, or it can outsource the function and buy the service. Currently, there has been a growing interest in the third option, i.e. outsourcing of logistics functions to third party logistics service providers.

Divyanshi Road Lines  Maps and understands these requirements to place it in the framework of logical execution and provides 3pl, 4pl services.

      description: "End-to-End Supply Chain Management",
      detail: `Supply chain is defined as a set of three or more companies directly linked by one or more of the upstream and downstream flows of the products, services, finances and information from a source to a customer. It consists of all the stages involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a customer's demand. It not only includes the manufacturer and suppliers, but also transporters, warehouses, retailers and customers themselves. Within an organization, the supply chain includes all the functions involved in fulfilling a customer demand. These functions include, but are not limited to, new product development, marketing, operations, distribution, finance and customer service.

The objective of the supply chain is to maximize the overall value generated. The value a supply chain generates is the difference between what the final product is worth to the customer and the effort the supply chain expends in filling the customer‚Äôs demand. It is strongly correlated with the supply-chain profitability, the difference between the revenue generated from the customer and the overall costs across the supply chain.
